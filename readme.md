1. Start a React application with Vite
There are many different ways to get started when building a React application. One of the easiest and most popular ways currently is to use Vite to scaffold and set up your application.

To get started, run this command in a directory where you would like your application's code to live:

npm create vite@latest react-client -- --template react-ts
Note: You don't need to install any packages before running this command.

This command set up a ready-to-go React project in a folder named react-client using a TypeScript template. The template comes with a development server, hot module replacement, and a build process out of the box.

Once your project has been generated you will be prompted to enter the new directory, install the node modules, and run the project. Go ahead and do that by running the following commands:

cd react-client
npm install
npm run dev


2. Set up TailwindCSS
Your application will use TailwindCSS to make designing and styling your components easy. To get started, you will first need a few new dependencies:

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
The command above will install all of the pieces TailwindCSS requires to work in your project, including the Tailwind CLI. Initialize TailwindCSS in your project using the newly installed CLI:

npx tailwindcss init -p
This command created two files in your project:

tailwind.config.cjs: The configuration file for TailwindCSS
postcss.config.cjs: The configuration file for PostCSS

3. Create a TypeScript project
To kick things off, create a new folder in your working directory that will contain your GraphQL server's code wherever you would like:

mkdir graphql-server # Example folder
This project will use npm, a package manager for Node.js, to manage and install new packages. Navigate into your new folder and initialize npm using the following commands:

cd graphql-server
npm init -y
Install the basic packages
While building this API, you will install various packages that will help in the development of your application. For now, install the following development packages:

ts-node-dev: Allows you to execute TypeScript code with live-reload on file changes
typescript: The TypeScript package that allows you to provide typings to your JavaScript applications
@types/node: TypeScript type definitions for Node.js
npm i -D ts-node-dev typescript @types/node

4. Set up TypeScript
With TypeScript installed in your project, you can now initialize the TypeScript configuration file using the tsc command-line interface tool (CLI):

npx tsc --init
The above command will create a new file named tsconfig.json at the root of your project and comes with a default set of configurations for how to compile and handle your TypeScript code. For the purposes of this series, you will leave the default settings.

Create a new folder named src and within that folder a new file named index.ts:

mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
